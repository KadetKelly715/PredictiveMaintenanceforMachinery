## Overall Project: 

1. **Scope:**
    Develop a predictive maintenance system for machinery that uses histrocial data to forecast maintenance needs. The system will include data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. It will also include a user-friendly interface for monitoring equipment status and generating reports.

2. **Requirements:**
    - Data Collection:
        Collect historical maintenance data and sensor data from machinery.
        Ensure data is in a usable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
    - Data Processing: 
        Clean and preprocess the collected data.
        Handle missing or inconsistent data.
    - Data Analysis:
        Implement statistical methods to analyze patterns in the data.
        Develop predictive models using machine learning techniques.
    - Data Storage:
        Store processed data efficiently for quick access and analysis.
        Use appropriate file handling techniques.
    - Visualization:
        Create visualizations to display real-time sensor data and maintenance predictions.
        Develop dashboards for monitoring machinery status.
    - User Interface:
        Build a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
        Allow users to input new data, view visualizations, and generate reports.
    - Testing & Validation:
        Implement unit tests for all functions and classes.
        Ensure the system handles exceptions and errors gracefully.
    - Documentation:
        Document the code, including comments and usage instructions.
        Provide a user manual for the system.

## Python Basics

1. **Scope:**

    Lay the foundation for the project by understanding Python syntax, data types, and basic programming constructs.

2. **Requirements:**

    - Write simple scripts to read and process sensor data.
    - Simulate evaluation of expressions and update reference diagrams.
    - Handle different data types: strings, integers, floats.
    - Recognize valid vs. invalid variable names.
    - Write and understand basic multi-line programs.
    - Invoke methods and set attributes using dot notation.
    - Handle basic errors (syntax, runtime, semantic).

## Python Functions Files Dictionaries

1. **Scope:**

    Develop the ability to read from and write to files, and use functions and dictionaries for data manipulation.

2. **Requirements:**

    - Read and write data to/from files.
    - Use CSV format for handling data.
    - Implement file handling techniques (using with statement).
    - Use dictionaries for organizing and managing data.
    - Write functions for modularity and reusability.
    - Handle tuples and understand their use in functions.

## Data Collection and Processing

1. **Scope:**

    Learn to collect, process, and analyze data efficiently using advanced Python techniques.

2. **Requirements:**

    - Work with nested data structures and perform nested iterations.
    - Process JSON data and extract relevant information.
    - Use map, filter, and list comprehensions for data manipulation.
    - Interact with internet APIs to fetch data if necessary.

## Python Classes and Inheritance

1. **Scope:**

    Implement object-oriented programming to model machinery and maintenance records.

2. **Requirements:**

    - Define classes for machinery, sensors, and maintenance records.
    - Use inheritance to extend functionality.
    - Handle class variables and instance variables appropriately.
    - Sort lists of instances and handle objects as parameters.

## pillow tesseract and openvc

1. **Scope:**

    Integrate computer vision techniques for visual inspections and advanced data analysis.

2. **Requirements:**

    - Use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing.
    - Implement optical character recognition (OCR) with Tesseract.
    - Use OpenCV for computer vision tasks and integrate this with the predictive maintenance system.
    - Develop Jupyter notebooks for documentation and presentation.
